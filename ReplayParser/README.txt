Only the file CreateTrainingDataFromReplays.py file was made for this project.

The replay files folder was filled with the replays found in this group: https://ballchasing.com/group/forai-rwrbziefu9

Example of the output from this program can be found in the "Resources/TrainingData/" folder of the neural network training unity project.
